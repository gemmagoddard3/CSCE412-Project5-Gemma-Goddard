                    The mission of He Before Me is to let the goodness of God be known to all. He Before Me sells
                    t-shirts, crewnecks, stickers, and digital prints. Opening and operating my business has been a
                    challenging endeavor, but it sparked my interest in website design. I have gained an appreciation
                    for understanding user needs and thinking in the eyes of the user. I have had three website
                    iterations, and am continually trying to improve it to optimize the user's interaction with my
                    website. I use a third-party service to build and operate my website, but I aspire to enhance and
                    personalize my website more with increased knowledge in HTML and CSS learned in this class. </p>

                    design a webpage highlighting their past projects and displaying available job openings. This
                    project involved client meetings to comprehend their requirements and follow the UX design process
                    learned in my Google UX design certification course to develop an efficient website. The project is
                    currently in progress but is anticipated to be finished soon. Similar to my small business, this
                    project was developed using a third-party application. However, I aim to utilize the insights gained
                    from this course to enhance this project.</p>

                    grocery list for meals I cook frequently. The functionality of this app would entail uploading your
                    recipes to the app through a picture or pdf, and each week the user would choose which meals they
                    want to make, and the app would generate the list for them. I seek to apply the skills I learn this
                    year to develop this app and hopefully release it to others.</p>
